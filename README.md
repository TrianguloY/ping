# Custom ping

Send a custom message to a discord server by accesing a url.

In progress

## Deploy custom server
If you want to deploy your own copy for personal use, just:
1) Fork the project (or copy/paste it, but forking is nicer and it will automatically comply with the license, otherwise you need to mention me).
1) Deploy your fork to Heroku or any other web service. The app is ready-to-deploy on Heroku, but it is just a Flask one-file app so other services should be fine.
1) Use your own url for the webhooks. In the second step of 'Usage' simply use your deployment url instead of mine.

## Contributions
Although this project was made for personal use, if you want to send pull requests or make/suggest changes I'll be happy to discuss them. The conversion was manually made so it may not have all type of events into consideration.
